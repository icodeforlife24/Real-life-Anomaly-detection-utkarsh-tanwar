# Real-life-Anomaly-Detection
This project under SoC, deploys Anomaly Algorithm(Unsupervised) to detect distinct pedestrian behaviour in surveillance footages

### Till week 4 I have learned
- CNN and Its implementation-
   - Learned how convulation, padding, strided convulation works. also explored notations in CNN
- Filters And Pooling
     - Learned to apply filters and pooling layers along the RGB channels
- openCV
   - Learned the basics on image manipulation using openCV library and working on webcam and video as well
- YOLO V5
  - learned sliding window detection and its diadvantages.
  -learned the concep of overlapping and i/o ratio
  - learned anchor boxes
  - learned the YOLOV5 mechanism
- Implementing YOLOV5 on MOTY17 pedestrian Dataset
    - implemented YOLOV5 model (small,medium and medium with frezed layers) on dataset
